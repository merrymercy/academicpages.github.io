# About
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [EECS department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and [Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).

My research interests lie on the intersection of machine learning and programming systems, especially compiler optimizations and program synthesis. I work on both directions: using machine learning to automate the systems and building systems to accelerate machine learning.

I received my B.S degree in computer science from ACM Honors Class, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn). 
I was a research intern at University of Washington, working with [Tianqi Chen](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/) and [Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/).
I am a PMC member of [Apache TVM](https://tvm.ai/).
